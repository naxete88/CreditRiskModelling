# CreditRiskModelling
As a banking entity, do you want to know what probability your client has of not returning the money you lend them? Use Data Science to find out.

Credit risk is the possibility that a borrower will not be able to make timely payments and will default on their debt. It refers to the possibility that a lender may not get the interest or principle due to them on time.

Credit risk is a very important factor for banks and family organizations. For this reason, it is vital to know whether or not a client can return the money that has been lent to them.

  Machine Learning Models have helped these companies in improving the accuracy of their credit risk analysis by giving a scientific technique for predicting potential debtors.
  
  In this project, first the data is pre-processed, the risk of default is visualized with the other variables, then a Machine Learning exercise is carried out with 3 algorithms to see which one can best explain the model.
 Subsequently, the optimal parameters are searched to find the best model.
 Finally it is assessed with cross-validation.
